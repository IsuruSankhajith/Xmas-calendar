# Xmas-calendar



An interactive web-based calendar for December 2024, featuring dynamic visuals such as stars, balls, and socks drawn on specific days. The calendar is implemented using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Day Display**: Each day displays either a number or a custom-drawn graphic (e.g., a star, ball, or sock).
- **Canvas-Based Graphics**: Utilizes HTML5 `<canvas>` for rendering items.
- **Modular Design**: Separate JavaScript files (`draw.js`, `star.js`, `ball.js`, `sock.js`) manage drawing functionality.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes with CSS styling.

## Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ draw.js          # Main script for rendering on the canvas
